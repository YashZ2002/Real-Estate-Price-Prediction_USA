# **Real Estate Price Prediction (USA)**

This project, developed during my first semester of Masters at Northeastern University, is dedicated to accurately predicting the future value of houses in the USA. Leveraging Python, machine learning techniques, and advanced feature engineering, we aim to provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Objective:** Spearheaded a Housing Price Prediction project focusing on implementing Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree models to forecast property values with an impressive 85% accuracy rate.
  
- **Data Processing:** Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring high-quality inputs for our predictive models. Implemented advanced feature engineering techniques, including sentiment analysis and column normalization, resulting in a significant 40% improvement in model performance.

- **Model Selection:** Employed a rigorous process of model selection, refining our algorithms through hyperparameter tuning and exploratory data analysis. This iterative approach led to a remarkable 30% increase in prediction accuracy, enhancing the reliability of our forecasts.

# **Introduction**

**Background:**

The housing price prediction project is a cutting-edge initiative aimed at leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast real estate values based on a comprehensive set of factors. By incorporating features such as the property's location, historical housing prices in the area, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the overall area of the house, the project seeks to create a predictive model that can offer valuable insights into future property values.

**Motivation:**

Our motivation for this housing price prediction project is grounded in the need to provide valuable insights for participants in the real estate market. Similar to the cryptocurrency market, where price fluctuations and market sentiment are crucial, the housing market also faces challenges influenced by factors like location, historical pricing, and property attributes.

**Goal:**

Our project objectives extend to analyzing historical data in the real estate domain, aiming to identify patterns, trends, and influential factors for predictive modeling. By scrutinizing neighboring property values and broader housing market dynamics, our goal is to develop a robust predictive model for housing prices, enabling informed decision-making even in cases where specific past data is unavailable.

**Methodology**

**Data Pre-processing:**

This involves handling missing values, addressing outliers, standardizing and normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Additionally, feature engineering, dealing with duplicates, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets are key steps.

**Data Analysis:**

This involves analyzing summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for each property. In addition to numerical and categorical exploration of the data, one can conduct correlation analyses between variables, investigate sentiment scores derived from property descriptions, and visualize property prices.

**Feature Engineering:**

In housing price prediction, feature engineering is crucial for transforming raw data into informative model input. Key features include historical property values, square footage trends, and neighborhood characteristics. Lag features, moving averages, and sentiment indicators capture historical dynamics, while normalization ensures consistency.

**Model Selection:**

In our approach to housing price prediction, we adopt a diverse set of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. These models, trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising historical housing prices and property attributes, collectively aim to forecast property values and discern trends in the dynamic real estate market.

# **Dataset**

**Description:**

This dataset provides details about various real estate listings, encompassing information such as the region, price, property type (e.g., "apartment" or "condo"), square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as amenities such as whether cats or dogs are allowed, smoking policies, wheelchair access, and availability of electric vehicle charging.

Additionally, the dataset includes a sentiment score derived from the textual descriptions of each property. The descriptions capture key features and characteristics of the listings, offering a comprehensive view for potential renters or buyers. This dataset is valuable for tasks such as price prediction, trend analysis, and understanding the impact of property descriptions on sentiment.
