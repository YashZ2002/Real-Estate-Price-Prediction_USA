# **Real Estate Price Prediction (USA)**

This project, developed during my first semester of Masters at Northeastern University, is dedicated to accurately predicting the future value of houses in the USA. Leveraging Python, machine learning techniques, and advanced feature engineering, we aim to provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Objective:** Spearheaded a Housing Price Prediction project focusing on implementing Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree models to forecast property values with an impressive 85% accuracy rate.
  
- **Data Processing:** Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring high-quality inputs for our predictive models. Implemented advanced feature engineering techniques, including sentiment analysis and column normalization, resulting in a significant 40% improvement in model performance.

- **Model Selection:** Employed a rigorous process of model selection, refining our algorithms through hyperparameter tuning and exploratory data analysis. This iterative approach led to a remarkable 30% increase in prediction accuracy, enhancing the reliability of our forecasts.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Analysis:** In-depth exploration of historical real estate data to identify meaningful patterns and insights.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Implementation of advanced techniques to extract valuable features and enhance predictive performance.
  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilization of Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree models, and other algorithms to predict housing prices.
  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Incorporation of location-based information to capture regional variations in property values.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
  
- **Visualization:** Visual representation of data insights and model predictions using charts, graphs, and interactive maps.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
